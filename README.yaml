# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  The module provisions the following resources:
    - `helm_release` describes the desired status of a chart in a kubernetes cluster.
      - A Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. A Chart is a Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster.
    - `helm_repository` describes a helm repository.
      - A chart repository is a location where packaged charts can be stored and shared.

  **IMPORTANT:** 
    - The module has many flags and arugments to pass as variables for the `helm_release`, and `helm_repository`. Please check the `variables.tf` in this repository for more information.

examples: |-
  ### Advanced Example 1

  The following example generates a EKS managed node group and deploys and annotates pods with a helm chart to deploy into those respective workers exclusively.
